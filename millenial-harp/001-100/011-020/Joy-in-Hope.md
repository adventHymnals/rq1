1. 
Children of the heavenly King, 
As ye journey sweetly sing; 
Sing your Savior’s worthy praise, 
Glorious in his works and ways. 
We are traveling home to God, 
In the way the fathers trod; 
They are happy now and we 
Soon their happiness shall see.

2. 
Shout ye little flock, and blest, 
You near Jesus throne shall rest; 
There your seats are now prepared, 
There your kingdom and reward. 
Fear not, brethren, joyful stand 
On the borders of your land: 
Jesus Christ, your Father’s son, 
Bids you undismay’d go on.
