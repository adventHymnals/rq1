1. 
Farewell, farewell, farewell, dear friends, 
I must be gone, 
I have no home or stay with you; 
I’ll take my staff and travel on, 
Till I a better world do view.

[Chorus] I’ll march to Canaan’s land, 
I’ll land on Canaan’s shore, 
Where pleasures never end,  
Where troubles come no more. 
Farewell, farewell, farewell, 
my loving friends, farewell.

2. 
Farewell, my friends, time rolls along, 
Nor waits for mortals’ care or bliss; 
I leave you here, and travel on, 
Till I arrive where Jesus is. 
I’ll march, etc.

2[sic] 
Farewell, my brethren in the Lord, 
To you I’m bound in cords of love; 
Yet we believe his gracious word, 
That soon we all shall meet above. 
I’ll march, & c.

4. 
Farewell, old soldiers of the cross, 
You’ve struggled long and hard for heaven; 
You’ve counted all things here but dross, 
Fight on, the crown will soon be given. 
I’ll march, & c. 
Fight on, & c.

5. 
Farewell, poor careless sinners too, 
It grieves my heart to leave you here, 
Eternal vengeance waits for you; 
O turn, and find salvation near. 
I’ll march, & c. 
O turn, & c.
