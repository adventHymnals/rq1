1. 
Jesus, my all to heav’n is gone; 
I want to wear the crown, 
He whom I fix my hopes upon; 
I want to wear the crown, 
Oh my heart says praise the Lord, 
my heart says praise the Lord, 
my heart says praise the Lord, 
I want to wear the crown.

2. 
The way the holy prophets went, 
I want to wear the crown, 
The road that leads from banishment; 
I want to wear the crown, 
Oh my heart says praise the Lord, 
my heart says praise the Lord, 
my heart says praise the Lord, 
I want to wear the crown.

3. 
His track I see, and I’ll pursue, 
I want to wear the crown, 
The narrow way, till him I view, 
I want to wear the crown; 
Oh my heart says, etc.

4. 
The King’s highway of holiness, 
I want to wear the crown, 
I’ll go, for all his paths are peace. 
I want to wear the crown. 
Oh my heart says, etc.

5. 
Lo! glad I come, and thou, blest Lamb, 
I want to wear the crown, 
Shalt take me to thee whose I am; 
I want to wear the crown, 
Oh my heart says, etc.

6. 
Nothing but sin have I to give, 
I want to wear the crown, 
Nothing but love shall I receive. 
I want to wear the crown, 
Oh my heart says praise, etc.

7. 
Then will I tell to sinners round, 
I want to wear the crown, 
What a dear Savior I have found, 
I want to wear the crown, 
Oh my heart says, etc.

8. 
I’ll point to thy redeeming blood, 
I want to wear the crown, 
And say, ‘Behold the way to God!’ 
I want to wear the crown, 
Oh my heart says, etc.
