Dolce. 
1 
Oh! Land of rest, for thee I sigh, 
When will the moment come, 
When I shall lay my armor by, 
And dwell with Christ at home.

2. 
No tranquil joys on earth I know, 
No peaceful sheltering dome; 
This world’s a wilderness of wo, 
This world is not my home.

3. 
To Jesus Christ I sought for rest, 
He bade me cease to roam; 
And fly for succor to his breast, 
And he’d conduct me home.

4. 
I would at once have quit this place, 
Where foes in fury roam, 
But ah! my passport was not sealed, 
I could not yet go home.

5. 
When by afflictions sharply tried, 
I view the gaping tomb; 
Although I dread death’s chilling flood, 
Yet still I sigh for home.

6. 
Weary of wandering round and round, 
This vale of sin and gloom; 
I long to leave th’unhallowed ground, 
And dwell with Christ at home.
