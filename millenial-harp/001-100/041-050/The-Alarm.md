        Millenial Harp 049. The Alarm. 1. Slow, We are living, we are dwelling, In a grand and awful time; In an age on ages telling, To be living is sublime. Lively. Hark! the waking up of nations,  Gog and Magog to the fray; Hark! what soundeth? is creation Groaning for its latter day?

1. 
Slow, 
We are living, we are dwelling, 
In a grand and awful time; 
In an age on ages telling, 
To be living is sublime. 
Lively. 
Hark! the waking up of nations,  
Gog and Magog to the fray; 
Hark! what soundeth? is creation 
Groaning for its latter day?

2. 
Will ye play, then, will ye dally, 
With your music and your wine? 
Up! it is Jehovah’s rally! 
God’s own arm hath need of thine. 
Hark! the onset! will ye fold your 
Faith-clad arms in lazy lock? 
Up, O up, thou drowsy soldier; 
Worlds are charging to the shock.

3. 
Worlds are charging-heaven beholding; 
Thou hast but an hour to fight; 
Now the blazoned cross unfolding, 
On-right onward, for the right. 
On! let all the soul within you 
For the truth’s sake go abroad! 
Strike! let every nerve and sinew 
Tell on ages-tell for God!
