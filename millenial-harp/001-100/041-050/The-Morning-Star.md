        Millenial Harp 048. The Morning Star. 1.  The night is wearing fast away,  A streak of light is dawning, Sweet harbinger of that bright day, The fair Millennial morning.  Gloomy and dark the night has been, And long the way, and dreary;  And sad the weeping saints are seen, And faint, and worn and weary.

1. 
 The night is wearing fast away, 
 A streak of light is dawning, 
Sweet harbinger of that bright day, 
The fair Millennial morning. 
 Gloomy and dark the night has been, 
And long the way, and dreary;  
And sad the weeping saints are seen, 
And faint, and worn and weary.

2. 
 Ye mourning pilgrims, cease your tears, 
 
f The light of that bright morn appears,— 
The long sabbatic morrow. 
 Lift up your heads—behold from far 
A flood of splendor streaming! 
It is the bright and Morning-Star, 
In living lustre beaming!

3. 
And see that star-like host around 
Of angel bands, attending; 
Hark! hark! the trumpet’s glad’ning sound, 
‘Mid shouts triumphant blending. 
He comes, the Bridegroom promised long- 
Go forth with joy to meet him; 
And raise the new and nuptial song, 
In cheerful strains to greet him.

4. 
Adorn thyself, the feast prepare, 
While bridal strains are swelling; 
He comes, with thee all joys to share, 
And make this earth his dwelling. 
 Lift up your heads-behold from far 
A flood of splendor streaming! 
It is the bright and Morning-Star, 
In living lustre beaming!
