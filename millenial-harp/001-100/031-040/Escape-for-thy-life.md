####  Millenial Harp
```txt
1. 
See Sodom wrapt in fire! 
And hark, what piercing shrieks! 
Those daring rebels now expire, 
For God in justice speaks.

2. 
O sinner, mark thy fate! 
Soon will the Judge appear; 
And then thy cries will come too late; 
Too late for God to hear.

3. 
Thy day of mercy gone, 
The Spirit grieved away, 
Thy cup, long filling, now o’erflown, 
Demands the vengeful day.

4. 
Thy God, insulted, seems 
To draw his glittering sword; 
And o’er thy guilty head it gleams, 
To vindicate his word.

5. 
One only hope I see; 
Oh, sinner, seize it now,— 
The blood that Jesus shed for thee! 
No other hope hast thou.
