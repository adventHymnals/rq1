####  Millenial Harp
```txt
1. 
“How long, O Lord, how long?”— 
It was in heav’n 
That prayerful voice was heard, 
From souls forgiven.

2. 
Was heaven not enough? 
Happy, secure, 
Robed in eternal bliss 
Would they have more.

3. 
Jesus! they would have more- 
Even in bliss, 
The souls expectant wait 
More happiness.

4. 
They wait, even in heaven, 
Impatiently, 
To see this troubled world 
At peace with thee.

5. 
They would behold their King, 
Once crucified, 
Mistrusted still, disowned, 
And still denied,—

6. 
Jesus! they would behold 
Thy work complete, 
And misery and sin 
Beneath thy feet.

7. 
And may not we, too, join 
In heaven’s song? 
Should we alone not ask, 
“How long, how long?”
