1. 
This world is all a fleeting show, 
For man’s probation given; 
The smiles of joy, the tears of wo, 
Deceitful shine, deceitful flow; 
There’s nothing true as heaven.

2. 
Poor wanderers of a stormy day, 
From wave to wave we’er driven; 
And fancy’s flash, and reason’s ray 
Serve but to light us on the way; 
There’s nothing bright as heaven.

3. 
And where’s the hand held out to cheer 
The heart with anguish riven? 
For sorrow’s sigh, and trouble’s tear, 
Have never found a refuge here; 
There’s nothing kind as heaven.

4. 
In vain do mortals sigh for bliss, 
Without their sins forgiven: 
True pleasure, everlasting peace, 
Are only found in God’s free grace; 
There’s nothing good as heaven.

5. 
From those who walk in wisdom’s way, 
Corroding fears are driven; 
They’re wash’d in Christ’s atoning blood, 
Enjoy communion with their God, 
And find their way to heaven.
