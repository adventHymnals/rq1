1. 
The clouds at length are breaking; 
The dawn will soon appear, 
And “Signs” there’s no mistaking, 
Proclaim Messiah near. 
Awake, awake from sleeping, 
Attend the “midnight cry,” 
Ye saints, refrain from weeping, 
Your Great Deliverer’s nigh

2. 
The morning light is beaming; 
The “day-star” shines on high, 
Christ’s Heralds are proclaiming 
His coming in the sky; 
And earth’s eventful story 
A few short months will tell, 
The righteous rise to glory; 
The wicked sink to hell.

3. 
If earth and all her treasure, 
Are doom’d to fire and flame; 
Her Royal pomp, and pleasure 
Are but an  
Her Kings-her Crowns-her glory 
Her Armies-Fleets-and pride, 
May bubble forth her story 
While floating down the tide.

4. 
The Ocean, Oh! the ocean, 
To which  grandeurs tend 
Now foams in dreadful motion, 
Her boast and pomp to end. 
See, see, the flames ascending, 
The seas, themselves explode; 
The clouds,—the skies, are rending 
With cries of—‘God’—‘Oh! God’!!

5. 
Oh! hear the sad petition, 
“Rocks crush us into dust;” 
Oh! pity our condition- 
Or  we surely must 
We thought that we were wiser 
Than  and all 
Yet Sinner—Sceptic—miser— 
Must suffer once for all.

6. 
Ye mortals take the warning, 
Ten thousand calls invite; 
Should you neglect the morning 
Then comes the  
Now mercy’s hand extended. 
The vilest wretch would save; 
But Oh! if  be ended 
You’re lost beyond the grave.

7. 
Great Author of compassion 
Redeemer-Saviour-friend- 
Oh! send to every nation 
The knowledge of its end; 
Fly! fly on wings of morning, 
Ye who the truth can tell, 
And sound the awful warning, 
To rescue souls from
