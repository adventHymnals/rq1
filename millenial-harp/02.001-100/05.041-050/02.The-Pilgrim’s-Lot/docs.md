1. 
How happy is the pilgrim’s lot, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
How free from ev’ry anxious thought, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan. 
O Canaan! bright Canaan! 
I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
O Canaan, it is my happy home, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

2. 
Nothing on earth I call my own, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
A stranger to the world unknown, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
O Canaan, etc.

3. 
I trample on the whole delight, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
And seek a city out of sight, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
O Canaan, etc.

4. 
There is my house and portion fair, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
My treasure and my heart are there, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
O Canaan, etc.

5. 
For me my elder brethren stay, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
And angels beckon me away, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
O Canaan, etc.
