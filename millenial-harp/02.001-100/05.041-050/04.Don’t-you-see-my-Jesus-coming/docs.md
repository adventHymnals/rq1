        Millenial Harp 044. Don’t you see my Jesus coming. Don’t you see my Jesus coming? See him come in yonder cloud, With ten thousand angels round him, How they of my Jesus crowd. I am bound for the kingdom, Will you go to glory with me. Hallelujah, O Hallelujah, I’m bound for the kingdom, will you go to glory with me, Hallelujah, O praise ye the Lord.

Don’t you see my Jesus coming? 
See him come in yonder cloud, 
With ten thousand angels round him, 
How they of my Jesus crowd. 
I am bound for the kingdom, 
Will you go to glory with me. 
Hallelujah, O Hallelujah, 
I’m bound for the kingdom, 
will you go to glory with me, 
Hallelujah, O praise ye the Lord.
