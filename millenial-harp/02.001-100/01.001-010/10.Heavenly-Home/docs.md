1. 
Brethren, while we sojourn here, 
Fight we must, but should not fear; 
Foes we have, but we’ve a Friend, 
One that loves us to the end; 
Forward, then, with courage go, 
Long we shall not dwell below; 
Soon the joyful news will come, 
“Child, your Father calls, Come home.”

2. 
In the way, a thousand snares 
Lie to take us unawares; 
Satan, with malicious art, 
Watches each unguarded heart: 
But from Satan’s malice free, 
Saints shall soon in glory be; 
Soon the joyful news will come, 
“Child, your Father calls, Come home.”

3. 
But of all the foes we meet, 
None so oft misled our feet, 
None betray us into sin, 
Like the foes that dwell within: 
Yet let nothing spoil your peace, 
Christ shall also conquer these; 
 the joyful news will come, 
“Child, your father calls, Come home.”
