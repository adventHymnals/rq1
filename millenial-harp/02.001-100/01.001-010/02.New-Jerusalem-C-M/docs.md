1. 
Lo, what a glorious sight appears, 
To our believing eyes; 
‘The earth and seas are passed away, 
And the old rolling skies! 
And the old rolling skies! 
And the old rolling skies! 
The earth and seas are passed away, 
And the old rolling skies!

[Chorus] O that will be joyful, joyful, joyful, 
O that will be joyful, 
When we meet to part no more, 
When we meet to part no more, 
On Canaan’s happy shore. 
‘Tis there we’ll meet at Jesus’ feet, 
When we meet to part no more.

2. 
From the third heav’n, where God resides, 
That holy, happy place; 
The New Jerusalem comes down, 
Adorned with shining grace. 
Adorn’d with shining grace, 
Adorned with, etc. 
The new Jerusalem comes down, 
Adorn’d with shining grace.

3. 
Attending angels shout for joy, 
And the bright armies sing, 
“Mortals, behold the sacred seat 
Of your descending King! 
Of your descending King! 
Of your, etc. 
Mortals behold the sacred sear 
Of your descending King!

4. 
“The God of glory down to men 
Removes his blest abode; 
Men are the objects of his love, 
And he their gracious God.
