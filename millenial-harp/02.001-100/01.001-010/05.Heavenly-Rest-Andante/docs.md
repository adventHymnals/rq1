1. 
There in an hour of peaceful rest, 
To mourning wander’rs given; 
There is a joy for souls distress’d, 
A balm for every wounded breast, 
‘Tis found alone in heaven.

2. 
There is a soft, a downy bed, 
As fair as breath of even; 
A couch for weary mortals spread, 
Where they may rest the aching head, 
And find repose in heaven.

3. 
There is a home for weary souls, 
By sin and sorrow driven; 
When tossed on life’s tempestuous shoals, 
Where storms arise and ocean rolls 
And all is drear-but heaven.

4. 
There faith lifts up the tearless eye, 
To brighter prospects given; 
It views the tempest passing by, 
Sees evening shadows quickly fly, 
And all serene-in heaven.

5. 
There fragrant flowers immortal bloom, 
And joys supreme are given; 
There rays divine disperse the gloom:— 
Beyond the dark, the narrow tomb 
Appears the dawn of heaven.
