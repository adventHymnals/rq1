        Millenial Harp 007. Eden of Love. 1. How sweet to reflect on those joys that await me, In yon blissful region, the haven of rest, Where glorified spirits with welcome shall greet me, And lead me to mansions prepared for the blest; Encircled in light, and with glory enshrouded, My happiness perfect, my mind’s eye unclouded,  I’ll bathe in the ocean of pleasure unbounded, And range with delight thro’ the Eden of Love.

1. 
How sweet to reflect on those joys that await me, 
In yon blissful region, the haven of rest, 
Where glorified spirits with welcome shall greet me, 
And lead me to mansions prepared for the blest; 
Encircled in light, and with glory enshrouded, 
My happiness perfect, my mind’s eye unclouded,  
I’ll bathe in the ocean of pleasure unbounded, 
And range with delight thro’ the Eden of Love.

2. 
While angelic legions, with harps tuned celestial, 
Harmoniously join in the concert of praise, 
The saints, as they flock from the regions terrestrial, 
In loud hallelujahs their voices will raise: 
Then songs to the Lamb shall re-echo thro’ heaven, 
My soul will respond, To Immanuel be given 
All glory, all honor, all might and dominion, 
Who brought us thro’ grace to the Eden of Love.

3. 
Then hail, blessed state! hail, ye songsters of glory! 
Ye harpers of bliss, soon I’ll meet you above! 
And join your full choir in rehearsing the story, 
“Salvation from sorrow, through Jesus’s love:” 
Though ‘prisoned in earth, yet by anticipation, 
Already my soul feels a sweet prelibation 
Of joys that await me, when freed from probation: 
My heart’s now in Heaven, the Eden of Love.
