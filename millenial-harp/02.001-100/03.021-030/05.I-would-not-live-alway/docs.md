####  Millenial Harp
```txt
1. 
I would not live alway: I ask not to stay, 
Where storm after storm rises o’er the dark way 
The few lurid mornings that dawn on us here, ... 
Are enough for life’s woes, full enough for its cheer.

2. 
I would not live alway: No-welcome the tomb, 
Sice[sic] Jesus has lain there, I dread not its gloom 
There, sweet be my rest, till he bid me arise, .... 
To hail him in triumph descending the skies.

3. 
Who, who would live alway, away from his God? 
Away from yon heaven, that blissful abode, 
Where rivers of pleasure flow o’er the bright plains, 
And the noon-tide of glory eternally reigns;

4. 
Where saints of all ages in harmony meet, 
Their Savior and brethren, transported to greet? 
Where anthems of rapture unceasingly roll. 
And the smile of the Lord is the feast of the soul.
