        Millenial Harp 028. Star of Bethlehem. 1. When marshall’d on the nightly plain, The glittering hosts bestud the sky, One star alone, of all the train, Can fix the sinner’s wandering eye: Hark! Hark! to God the chorus breaks, From ev’ry host, from ev’ry gem; But one alone, the Savior speaks, It is the star of Bethlehem.

1. 
When marshall’d on the nightly plain, 
The glittering hosts bestud the sky, 
One star alone, of all the train, 
Can fix the sinner’s wandering eye: 
Hark! Hark! to God the chorus breaks, 
From ev’ry host, from ev’ry gem; 
But one alone, the Savior speaks, 
It is the star of Bethlehem.

2. 
Once on the raging seas I rode, 
The storm was loud, the night was dark, 
The ocean yawn’d, and rudely blow’d 
The wind that toss’d my foundering bark. 
Deep horror then my vitals froze, 
Death struck-I ceased the tide to stem: 
When suddenly a star arose, 
It was the Star of Bethlehem.

3. 
It was my guide, my light, my all, 
It bade my dark foreboding cease; 
And thro’ the storm and danger’s thrall, 
It led me to the port of peace. 
Now safely moor’d-my perils o’er, 
I’ll sing first in night’s diadem, 
Forever and forevermore, 
The Star-the Star of Bethlehem.
