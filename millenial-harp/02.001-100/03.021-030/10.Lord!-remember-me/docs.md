## 030. LORD! REMEMBER ME
####  Millenial Harp
```txt
1. 
Jesus! thou art the sinner’s Friend, 
As such I look to thee ....... 
Now in the bowels of thy love, 
Oh Lord! remember me.

[Chorus] 
Oh, Lord! remember me ..... 
Oh, Lord, remember me ..... 
Now in the bowels of thy love, 
Oh Lord! remember me.

2. 
Remember thy pure word of grace, 
Remember Calvary; 
Remember all thy dying groans, 
And then remember me.

3. 
Thou wondrous Advocate with God! 
I yield myself to thee 
While thou art sitting on thy throne, 
Oh, Lord! remember me.

4. 
I own I’m guilty, own I’m vile, 
Yet thy salvation’s free: 
Then, in thy all-abounding grace, 
Oh, Lord! remember me.

5. 
Howe’er forsaken or distressed, 
Howe’er oppressed I be, 
Howe’er afflicted here on earth, 
Do thou remember me.

6. 
And when I close my eyes in death, 
And creature helps all flee, 
Then, oh my great Redeemer, God! 
I pray, remember me.
