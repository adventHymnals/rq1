####  Millenial Harp
```txt
1. 
Mid scenes of confusion and creature complaints, 
How sweet to my soul is communion with saints; 
To find at the banquet of mercy there’s room, 
And feel in the presence of Jesus at home.

CHORUS. 
Home, home, sweet, sweet home, 
Prepare me, dear Savior, to glory, my home.

2. 
Sweet bonds that unite all the children of peace! 
And thrice precious Jesus whose love cannot cease, 
Though oft from thy presence in sadness I roam, 
I long to behold thee, in glory at home.

Home, home, sweet, sweet home, 
Prepare me, dear Savior, to glory, my home.

3. 
I sigh from this body of sin to be free, 
Which hinders my joy and communion with thee; 
Tho’ now my temptations like billows may foam, 
All, all will be peace, when I’m with thee at home.



4. 
While here in the valley of conflict I stay, 
O give me submission and strength as my day; 
In all my afflictions to thee would I come, 
Rejoicing in hope of my glorious home.



5. 
Whate’er thou deniest, O give me thy grace, 
The Spirit’s sure witness, and smiles of thy face; 
Indulge me with patience to wait at thy throne, 
And find even now a sweet foretaste of home.



6. 
I long, dearest Lord, in thy beauties to shine, 
No more as an exile, in sorrow to pine, 
And in thy dear image, arise from the tomb, 
With glorified millions to praise thee, at Home.

Home, home, sweet, sweet home, 
Prepare me, dear Savior, to glory, my home.
