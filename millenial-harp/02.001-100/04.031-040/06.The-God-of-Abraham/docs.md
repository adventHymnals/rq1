####  Millenial Harp
```txt
1. 
The God of Abraham praise, 
Who reigns enthron’d above 
Ancient of everlasting days, 
And God of love; 
Jehovah, Great I Am! 
By earth and heav’n confess’d; 
I bow and bless the sacred name, 
Forever bless’d.

2. 
The God of Abraham praise, 
At whose supreme command 
From earth I rise-and seek the joys 
At his right hand: 
I all on earth forsake, 
Its wisdom, fame, and power, 
And him my only portion make, 
My shield and tower.

3. 
The God of Abraham praise; 
Whose all-sufficient grace 
Shall guide me all my happy days, 
In all his ways: 
He calls a worm his friend. 
He calls himself my God! 
And he shall save me to the end. 
Through Jesus’ blood.

4. 
He by Himself hath sworn, 
I on his oath depend, 
I shall on eagles’ wings upborne 
To Heaven ascend: 
I shall behold his face, 
I shall his power adore, 
And sing the wonders of his grace 
Forevermore.
