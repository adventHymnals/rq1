## 039. LIFT YOUR HEADS
####  Millenial Harp
```txt
1. 
Lift your heads, ye friends of Jesus, 
Partners in his patience here; 
Christ to all believers precious, 
Lord of lords, shall soon appear: 
Mark the tokens, 
Mark the tokens, 
Mark the tokens 
of his heavenly kingdom near.

2. 
Hear all nature’s groans proclaiming 
Nature’s swift approaching doom! 
War, and pestilence, and famine, 
Signify the wrath to come; 
Cleaves the centre, 
Nations rush into the tomb.

3. 
Close behind the tribulation 
Of the last tremendous days, 
See the flaming Revelation! 
See the universal blaze! 
Earth and heaven 
Melt before the Judge’s face.

4. 
Sun and moon are both confounded, 
Darken’d into endless night, 
When with angel-hosts surrounded, 
In his Father’s glory bright, 
Beams the Savior, 
Shines the everlasting light.

5. 
See the stars from heaven falling! 
Hark! on earth the doleful cry! 
Men on rocks and mountains calling, 
While the frowning Judge draws nigh; 
Hide us, hide us, 
Rock and mountains, from his eye!

6. 
With what different exclamation 
Shall the saints his banner see! 
By the monuments of his passion, 
By the marks received for  
All discern him, 
All with shouts cry out—“‘Tis He!”

7. 
“Lo! ‘tis He! our heart’s desire, 
Come for his espoused below; 
Come to join us with the choir, 
Come to make our joys o’erflow: 
Palms of victory, 
Crowns of glory to bestow.”

8. 
Yes, the prize shall sure be given; 
We his open face shall see: 
Love, the earnest of our heaven, 
Love our full reward shall be; 
Love shall crown us 
Kings thro’ all eternity.
