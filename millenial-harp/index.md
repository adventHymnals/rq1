# Preface

THE Harp, in its present form, embraces nearly all the hymns contained in our well-known works, - the "Millenial Harp", "Musings", and "Melodies" - (those only having been ommited which rarely, if ever, sung), and is designed to furnish a more complete and convenient selection, to be used in our Advent meetings. The hurry with which the above-named works were got through the press, necessarily made them, in many respects, defective; though, with all their defects, they have been the means of accomplishing a vast amount of good, by conveying the truth to the mind of those who were in the dark, and awakening the careless; by inspiring new hope in the fainting soul, quickeing the languid, and giving utterance to the burning desires and sublime expectations of those who are longing for the appearance of Jesus Christ.

We are aware of the difficulty of suiting the taste of all classes in musical and devotional compositions; the greatest possible diversity for this purpose, which is consistent with the nature of the work in which we are are engaged, must therefore be allowed. Some of our hymns, which might be objected to by the more grave and intellectualm and to which we ourselves have never felt any great partiality, have been the means of reaching, for good, te hearts of those who, probablym would not otherwise have affected; and as our object, like that of the Apostle is to *save men*, we should not hesitate to use all means lawful, that may promise to "save some".

The general expression of approbation which our former works have called forth, assures us that this effort to improve our *Advent Harp* will be appreciated by all the true friends of the Advent Cause.
