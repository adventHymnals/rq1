<p>_1 Abide with me, fast falls the eventide; The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide! When other helpers fail, and comforts flee, Help of the helpless, O abide with me!</p>
<p>_2 Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away Change and decay in all around I see; O Thou, who changest not, abide with me!</p>
<p>_3 I need Thy presence every passing hour; What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power? Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be? Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me!</p>
<p>_4 I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless; Ills have no weight,and tears no bitterness: Where is death’s sting? where, grave, thy victory? I triumph still if Thou abide with me!</p>

<p>_2 All the way my Savior leads me; Cheers each winding path I tread; Gives me grace for every trial, Feeds me with the living bread; Though my weary steps may falter, And my soul athirst may be, Gushing from the Rock before me, Lo, a spring of joy I see; Gushing from the Rock before me, Lo, a spring of joy I see. (&amp;c_l)</p>
<p>_3 All the way my Savior leads me; O the fullness of His love!

<p>_2 ’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear And grace my fears relieved How precious did that grace appear The hour I first believed</p>

<p>11 BEFORE JEHOVAH’S AWFUL THRONE Isaac Watts Before Jehovah’s awful throne, Ye nations bow with sacred joy, Know that the Lord is God alone, He can create and He destroy.</p>
<p>His sovereign power without our aid, Made us of clay, and formed us men; And when like wandering sheep we strayed, He brought us to His fold again</p>
<p>We will crowd His gates with thankful songs, High as the heavens our voices raise; And earth with her ten thousand tongues, Shall fill His courts with sounding praise.</p>
<p>Wide as the world is His command, Vast as Eternity His love; Firm as a rock His truth shall stand, When rolling years shall cease to move.</p>

<p>Beautiful robes, beautiful robes, Beautiful robes, We then shall wear, Garments of light, Lovely and bright, Walking with Jesus in white, Beautiful robes, we shall wear.</p>

<p>Side by side we stand awaiting God’s command, Worshiping the saving King.Living by His grace and moving on in faith; Jesus Himself will see us through.</p>

<p>Soldiers all are we to go where Jesus leads, We’ll fight in faith and we will overcome.Heaven is our goal, and saving every soul;Pray that we all will be there. Praise the Lord we all will be there!</p>
<p>BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO</p>
<p>15 P.P Bliss Hear the words our Savior hath spoken, Words of life, unfailing and true; Careless one, prayerless one, hear and remember, Jesus says, “Blessed are they that do.”</p>
<p>Blessed are they that do His commandments, Blessed are they, blessed are they; Blessed are they that do His commandments, Blessed, blessed, blessed are they.</p>
<p>All in vain we hear His commandments, All in vain His promises, too; Hearing them, fearing them, never can save us, Blessed, O</p>
<p>blessed, are they that do. They with joy may enter the city, Free from sin, from sorrow and strife, Sanctified, glorified, now and forever, They may have right to</p>
<p>the tree of life.</p>

<p>On the stormy sea Jesus speaks peace to me, And the billows cease to roll!</p>
<p>Bringing life and health and gladness, all around this heavenly Guest, banished unbelief and sadness, changed our weariness to rest Like the rain that falls from heaven, like the sunlight from the sky, so the Comforter is given, coming on us from on high.</p>
<p>Lo!Afruitful field is growing;blessed fruit of righteousness; And the stream of life are flowing, in the lonely wilderness What a wonderful salvation, Where we always see his face;</p>
<p>What a peaceful habitation, What a quiet resting place. 17 BREAK THOU THE BREAD OF LIFE Mary A. Lathbur</p>
<p>Break thou the bread of life, dear Lord, to me, as thou didst break the loaves beside the sea; beyond the sacred page I seek thee, Lord;my spirit pants for thee, O Living Word!</p>
<p>Bless thou the truth, dear Lord, to me, to me, as thou didst bless the bread by Galilee; then shall all bondage cease, all fetters fall; and i shall find my peace, my all in all.</p>

<p>WE’LL BUILD ON THE ROCK</p>
<p>18 F.E.Belden 1. We’ll build on the Rock, the living Rock, OnJesus,the Rock of Ages; So shall we abide the fearful shock, When loud the tempest rages.</p>
<p>We’ll build on the Rock, We’ll build on the Rock; We’ll build on the Rock, on the solid Rock, On Christ, the mighty Rock. 20</p>
<p>Some build on the sinking sands of life, On visions of earthly treasure; Some build on the waves of sin and strife, Of fame, and worldly pleasure.</p>
<p>O build on the Rock, for ever sure, The firm and the true foundation Its hope is the hope which shall endure, The hope of our salvation.</p>

<p>BRING THEM IN</p>
<p>Hark! ’tis the Shepherd’s voice I hear, Out in the desert dark and drear, Calling the sheep who’ve gone astray, Far from the Shepherd’s fold away. Bring them in, Bring them in, Bring them in from the fields of</p>
<p>W. A Ogden</p>
<p>sin;Bring them in, Bring them in, Bring the wanderers to Jesus. Who’ll go and help the Shepherd kind, Help Him the wandering ones to find? Who’ll bring them back into the fold, Where they’ll be sheltered from the cold?</p>
<p>Out in the desert hear their cry, Out on the mountain wild and high, Hark! ’tis the Master speaks to thee,” Go, find My sheep where ’er they be.”</p>
<p>20 CALLED TO THE FEAST</p>
<p>E.S.Lorenz</p>
<p>Called to the feast by the King are we, Sitting, perhaps, where His people he; How will it fare, friend, with thee and me When the King comes in?</p>
<p>When the King comes in, brother, When the King; comes in! How will it fare with thee and me When the King comes in? Crowns on the head where the thorns have been, Glorified He who</p>
<p>once died for men; Splendid the vision before us then, When the King comes in. Like lightning’s flash will that instant show Things hidden long from</p>
<p>both friend and foe; Just what we are will each neighbor know,</p>
<p>When the King comes in. Joyful His eyes shall on each one rest, who is in white wedding garments dressed; ah well for us if we stand the test, when the king</p>
<p>comes</p>
<p>20-a. JOY TO THE WORLD</p>
<p>Joy to the world, the Lord is come! Let earth receive her King; Let every heart prepare Him room, And heaven and nature sing, And heaven and nature sing, And heaven, And heaven and nature sing. Joy to the earth, the Saviour reigns! Let men their songs employ; While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains, Repeat the sounding joy, Repeat the sounding joy, Repeat; repeat the sounding joy.</p>

<p>I</p>
<p>he</p>

<p>Isaac.watt</p>
<p>No more let sin and sorrow grow, Nor thorns infest the ground; He comes to make his blessing flow, Far as the curse is found, Far as t curse is found, Far as, far as the curse is found</p>
<p>He rules the world with truth and grace, And makes the nation prove The glories of his righteousness, And wonders of his love, And wonders of his love, And wonders, and wonders of his love.</p>
<p>21 SOFTLY AND TENDERLY Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling, calling for you and for me; see, on the portals he’s waiting and watching, watching for you and for W.L. Thompson</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>Come home, come home; ye who are weary come home; earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, calling, O sinner, come home! Why should we tary when Jesus is pleading, pleading for you and for me? Why should we linger and heed not his mercies, mercies for you and for me?</p>
<p>22 CHIEF OF SINNERS</p>
<p>Chief of sinners though I be, Jesus shed His blood for me; Died that I might live on high, Died that I might never die; As the brance is to the vine, I am His, and He is mine.</p>
<p>O the height of Jesus’ love! Higher than the heaven above, Deeper than the deepest sea, Lasting as eternity; Love that found me wondrous thought! Found me when I sought Him not! Chief of sinners though I be, Christ is all in all to me; All my wants to Him are known, All my sorrows are His own; Safe with Him from earthly strife, He sustains the hidden life.</p>
<p>IT MAY BE AT MORN It may be at morn, when the day is awaking, When sunlight through darkness and shadow is breaking, That Jesus will come in the fullness of glory To receive from the world His own.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>M. William</p>

<p>O Lord Jesus, how long, how long Ere we shout the glad song? Christ returneth, Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Amen, Hallelujah! Amen.</p>

<p>ee,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>It may be at midday, it may be at twilight, It may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory, When Jesus receives His own.</p>
<p>O joy! O delight! should we go without dying, No sickness, no sadness, no dread, and no crying, Caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory, When Jesus receives His own. 24-JUST WHEN I NEED HIM MOST</p>
<p>William Poole</p>
<p>Just when I need Him, Jesus is near, Just when I falter, just when I fear; Ready to help me, ready to cheer, Just when I need Him most. Just when I need Him most, Just when I need Him most,</p>
<p>Jesus is near to comfort and cheer, Just when I need Him most. Just when I need Him, Jesus is true, Never forsaking all the way through; Giving for burdens pleasures anew, Just when I need Him</p>
<p>most. Just when I need Him, Jesus is strong, Bearing my burdens all the day long; For all my sorrow giving a song, Just when I need Him</p>
<p>most. Just when I need Him, He is my all. Answering when upon Him I call; Tenderly watching lest I should fall, Just when I need Him</p>
<p>most. 25 CLOSER TO THEE, MY FATHER, DRAW ME</p>
<p>Closer to Thee, my Father, draw me, I long for Thine embrace; Closer within Thine arms enfold me, I seek a resting place.</p>
<p>Closer with the cords of love, Draw me to Thyself above;</p>
<p>Closer draw me, To Thyself above. Closer to Thee, my Saviour, draw me Nor let me leave Thee more; Fain would I feel Thine arms around me, And count my wanderings o’er.</p>
<p>Closer by Thy sweet Spirit draw me Till I am all like Thee; Quicken, refine, and wash, and cleanse me, Till I am pure and free. 26 COUNT YOUR MERCIES</p>
<p>Are you heavy laden and with sorrow tried? Look to faith to Christ, your Helper, Friend, and Guide; Think of all your mercies, such a boundless store, Tears will change to praises as you count them o’er. 13</p>

<p>It may be at midday, it may be at twilight, It may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory, When Jesus receives His own.</p>
<p>O joy! O delight! should we go without dying, No sickness, no sadness, no dread, and no crying, Caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory, When Jesus receives His own. 24-JUST WHEN I NEED HIM MOST</p>
<p>Just when I need Him, Jesus is near, Just when I falter, just when I fear; Ready to help me, ready to cheer, Just when I need Him most. Just when I need Him most, Just when I need Him most, Jesus is near to comfort and cheer, Just when I need Him most.</p>
<p>William Poole</p>
<p>Just when I need Him, Jesus is true, Never forsaking all the way through; Giving for burdens pleasures anew, Just when I need Him</p>
<p>most. Just when I need Him, Jesus is strong, Bearing my burdens all the day long; For all my sorrow giving a song, Just when I need Him</p>
<p>most. On Just when I need Him, He is my all. Answering when upon Him I call; Tenderly watching lest I should fall, Just when I need Him</p>
<p>most. 25 CLOSER TO THEE, MY FATHER, DRAW ME</p>
<p>Closer to Thee, my Father, draw me, I long for Thine embrace; Closer within Thine arms enfold me, I seek a resting place.</p>
<p>Closer with the cords of love, Draw me to Thyself above;</p>
<p>Closer draw me, To Thyself above. Closer to Thee, my Saviour, draw me Nor let me leave Thee more; Fain would I feel Thine arms around me, And count my wanderings o’er.</p>
<p>Closer by Thy sweet Spirit draw me Till I am all like Thee; Quicken, refine, and wash, and cleanse me, Till I am pure and free.</p>
<p>26 COUNT YOUR MERCIES</p>
<p>e you heavy laden and with sorrow tried? Look to faith to Christ, Are your Helper, Friend, and Guide; Think of all your mercies, such a boundless store, Tears will change to praises as you count them o’er.</p>
