# Preface

THE Harp, in its present form, embraces nearly all the hymns contained in our well-known works, - the "Millenial Harp", "Musings", and "Melodies" - (those only having been ommited which rarely, if ever, sung), and is designed to furnish a more complete and convenient selection, to be used in our Advent meetings. The hurry with which the above-named works were got through the press, necessarily made them, in many respects, defective; though, with all their defects, they have been the means of accomplishing a vast amount of good, by conveying the truth to the mind of those who were in the dark, and awakening the careless; by inspiring new hope in the fainting soul, quickeing the languid, and giving utterance to the burning desires and sublime expectations of those who are longing for the appearance of Jesus Christ.

We are aware of the difficulty of suiting the taste of all classes in musical and devotional compositions; the greatest possible diversity for this purpose, which is consistent with the nature of the work in which we are are engaged, must therefore be allowed. Some of our hymns, which might be objected to by the more grave and intellectualm and to which we ourselves have never felt any great partiality, have been the means of reaching, for good, te hearts of those who, probablym would not otherwise have affected; and as our object, like that of the Apostle is to *save men*, we should not hesitate to use all means lawful, that may promise to "save some".

The general expression of approbation which our former works have called forth, assures us that this effort to improve our *Advent Harp* will be appreciated by all the true friends of the Advent Cause.

*Boston, October 23, 1843*

## 047. I WANT TO WEAR THE CROWN


```txt
Jesus, my all to heav’n is gone; 
I want to wear the crown, 
He whom I fix my hopes upon; 
I want to wear the crown, 
Oh my heart says praise the Lord, 
my heart says praise the Lord, 
my heart says praise the Lord, 
I want to wear the crown.
```
 
The way the holy prophets went, <br>
I want to wear the crown, 
The road that leads from banishment; 
I want to wear the crown, 
Oh my heart says praise the Lord, 
my heart says praise the Lord, 
my heart says praise the Lord, 
I want to wear the crown.

3. 
His track I see, and I’ll pursue, 
I want to wear the crown, 
The narrow way, till him I view, 
I want to wear the crown; 
Oh my heart says, etc.

4. 
The King’s highway of holiness, 
I want to wear the crown, 
I’ll go, for all his paths are peace. 
I want to wear the crown. 
Oh my heart says, etc.

5. 
Lo! glad I come, and thou, blest Lamb, 
I want to wear the crown, 
Shalt take me to thee whose I am; 
I want to wear the crown, 
Oh my heart says, etc.

6. 
Nothing but sin have I to give, 
I want to wear the crown, 
Nothing but love shall I receive. 
I want to wear the crown, 
Oh my heart says praise, etc.

7. 
Then will I tell to sinners round, 
I want to wear the crown, 
What a dear Savior I have found, 
I want to wear the crown, 
Oh my heart says, etc.

8. 
I’ll point to thy redeeming blood, 
I want to wear the crown, 
And say, ‘Behold the way to God!’ 
I want to wear the crown, 
Oh my heart says, etc.

## 048. THE MORNING STAR

```txt
1. 
 The night is wearing fast away, 
 A streak of light is dawning, 
Sweet harbinger of that bright day, 
The fair Millennial morning. 
 Gloomy and dark the night has been, 
And long the way, and dreary;  
And sad the weeping saints are seen, 
And faint, and worn and weary.

2. 
 Ye mourning pilgrims, cease your tears, 
 
f The light of that bright morn appears,— 
The long sabbatic morrow. 
 Lift up your heads—behold from far 
A flood of splendor streaming! 
It is the bright and Morning-Star, 
In living lustre beaming!

3. 
And see that star-like host around 
Of angel bands, attending; 
Hark! hark! the trumpet’s glad’ning sound, 
‘Mid shouts triumphant blending. 
He comes, the Bridegroom promised long- 
Go forth with joy to meet him; 
And raise the new and nuptial song, 
In cheerful strains to greet him.

4. 
Adorn thyself, the feast prepare, 
While bridal strains are swelling; 
He comes, with thee all joys to share, 
And make this earth his dwelling. 
 Lift up your heads-behold from far 
A flood of splendor streaming! 
It is the bright and Morning-Star, 
In living lustre beaming!

### 046. BLESSING OF THE NEW COVENANT

```txt
1. 
Ye who know your sins forgiven, 
And are happy in the Lord. 
Have you read that gracious promise, 
Which is left upon record: 
I will sprinkle you with water, 
I will cleanse you from all sin:  
Sanctify and make you holy, 
I will dwell and reign within.

2. 
Tho’ you have much peace and comfort, 
Greater things you yet may find, 
Freedom from unholy tempers, 
Freedom from the carnal mind. 
To procure your perfect freedom, 
Jesus suffer’d, groan’d, and died, 
On the cross the healing fountain, 
Gushed from his wounded side.

3. 
If you have obtained this treasure, 
Search and you shall surely find 
All the Christian marks and graces, 
Planted, growing, in your mind. 
Perfect faith, and perfect patience, 
Perfect lowliness, and then 
Perfect hope, and perfect meekness, 
Perfect love for God and man.

4. 
But be sure to gain the witness, 
Which asides both day and night; 
This your God has plainly promis’d, 
This is like a stream of light. 
While you keep the blessed witness, 
All is clear and calm within; 
God himself assures you by it 
That your heart is cleansed from sin.

5. 
Be as holy and as happy, 
And as useful here below, 
As it is your Father’s pleasures, 
Jesus, only Jesus know. 
Spread, O spread the holy fire, 
Tell, O tell what God has done, 
Till the nations are conformed 
To the image of his Son.

6. 
Witnesses might be produced, 
Of this glorious work of love, 
Paul and James, and John and Peter, 
Long before they went above. 
Hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, 
Have, and do, and will appear; 
Let me ask the solemn question, 
Has the Lord a witness here.

7. 
Wake up brother, wake up sister, 
Seek, O seek this holy state; 
None but holy ones can enter 
Thro’ the pure celestial gate. 
Can you bear the tho’t of losing 
All the joys that are above? 
No, my brother, no, my sister, 
God will perfect you in love.

I trample on the whole delight, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
And seek a city out of sight, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
O Canaan, etc.

4. 
There is my house and portion fair, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
My treasure and my heart are there, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
O Canaan, etc.

5. 
For me my elder brethren stay, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
And angels beckon me away, 
I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
O Canaan, etc.

Oh! Land of rest, for thee I sigh, 
When will the moment come, 
When I shall lay my armor by, 
And dwell with Christ at home.

2. 
No tranquil joys on earth I know, 
No peaceful sheltering dome; 
This world’s a wilderness of wo, 
This world is not my home.

3. 
To Jesus Christ I sought for rest, 
He bade me cease to roam; 
And fly for succor to his breast, 
And he’d conduct me home.

4. 
I would at once have quit this place, 
Where foes in fury roam, 
But ah! my passport was not sealed, 
I could not yet go home.

5. 
When by afflictions sharply tried, 
I view the gaping tomb; 
Although I dread death’s chilling flood, 
Yet still I sigh for home.

6. 
Weary of wandering round and round, 
This vale of sin and gloom; 
I long to leave th’unhallowed ground, 
And dwell with Christ at home.

And millions now are on the road-Will you go? Will you go?

2. 
We’re going to see the bleeding Lamb,—Will you go? 
In rapturous strains to praise his name,—Will you go? 
The crown of life we there shall wear, 
The conqueror’s palms our hands shall bear, 
And all the joys of heaven we’ll share,—Will you go?

3. 
We’re going to join the Heavenly Choir,—Will you go? 
To raise our voice and tune the lyre,—Will you go? 
There saints and angels gladly sing, 
Hosanna to their God and King, 
And make the heavenly arches ring,—Will you go?

4. 
Ye weary, heavy laden, come,—Will you go? 
In the blest house there still is room,—Will you go? 
The Lord is waiting to receive, 
If thou wilt on him now believe, 
He’ll give thy troubled conscience ease,—Come believe!

5. 
The way to Heaven is free for all—Will you go? 
For Jew and Gentile—great and small,—Will you go? 
Make up your mind, give God your heart, 
With every sin and idol part, 
And now for glory, make a start,—Come away!

6. 
The way to Heaven is strait and plain,—Will you go? 
Repent, believe, be born again,—Will you go? 
The Savior cries aloud to thee, 
“Take up thy cross and follow me,“ 
And thou shalt my salvation see,—Come to me!

7. 
O, could I hear some sinner say,—I will go? 
I’ll start this moment, clear the way,—Let me go! 
My old companions, fare you well, 
I will not go with you to hell, 
I mean with Jesus Christ to dwell,—Let me go! Fare you well.

With your music and your wine? 
Up! it is Jehovah’s rally! 
God’s own arm hath need of thine. 
Hark! the onset! will ye fold your 
Faith-clad arms in lazy lock? 
Up, O up, thou drowsy soldier; 
Worlds are charging to the shock.

3. 
Worlds are charging-heaven beholding; 
Thou hast but an hour to fight; 
Now the blazoned cross unfolding, 
On-right onward, for the right. 
On! let all the soul within you 
For the truth’s sake go abroad! 
Strike! let every nerve and sinew 
Tell on ages-tell for God!

## 018. JORDAN’S STORMY BANKS

```txt
1. 
On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand, 
And cast a wishful eye, 
To Canaan’s fair and happy land, 
Where my possessions lie. 
O, the transporting, rapturous scene, 
That rises To my sight! 
Sweet fields array’d in living green, 
And rivers of delight.

2. 
There gen’rous fruits that never fail, 
On trees immortal grow; 
There rocks and hills and brooks and vale, 
With milk and honey flow. 
All o’er those wide extended plains, 
Shines one eternal day; 
There God the Son forever reigns, 
And scatters night away.

3. 
No chilling winds, or poisonous breath 
Can reach that healthful shore; 
Sickness and sorrow, pain and death, 
Are felt and feared no more. 
When shall I reach that happy place, 
And be forever blest? 
When shall I see my Father’s face, 
And in his bosom rest?

4. 
Fill’d with delight, my raptured soul 
Would here no longer stay; 
Though Jordan’s waves around me roll, 
Fearless I’d launch away. 
There on those high and flowery plains, 
Our spirits ne’er shall tire; 
But in perpetual, joyful strains, 
Redeeming love admire.

## 017. “O TURN YE, O TURN YE, FOR WHY WILL YE DIE.”

```txt
1. 
O turn ye, O turn ye, for why will you die, 
When God in great mercy is coming so nigh? 
Now Jesus invites you, the Spirit says, Come, 
And angels are waiting to welcome you home.

2. 
How vain the delusion, that while you delay, 
Your hearts may grow better by staying away; 
Come wretched, come starving, come just as you be 
While streams of salvation are flowing so free.

3. 
And now Christ is ready your souls to receive, 
O how can you question, if you will believe? 
If sin is your burden, why will you not come? 
Tis you he bids welcome; he bids you come home.

4. 
In riches, in pleasures, what can you obtain, 
To soothe your affliction, or banish your pain? 
To bear up your spirit when summon’d to die, 
Or waft you to mansions of glory on high?

5. 
Why will you be starving and feeding on air? 
There’s mercy in Jesus, enough and to spare; 
If still you are doubting, make trial and see, 
And prove that his mercy is boundless and free.

6. 
Come, give us your hand, and the Savior your heart, 
And trusting in Heaven, we never shall part; 
O how can we leave you? why will you not come; 
We’ll journey together, and soon be at home. 
See hymn on page 30, “Millennial Musings.”

Who are waiting for salvation, 
Have your lamps trim’d and burning, 
For, behold the proclamation. 
Saying, “All things now are ready

All my fatlings now are kill’d,

O what a happy meeting, 
When salvation is completed, 
And tribulation’s ended, 
And the spotless robe prepared, 
For the Bride to be adorn’d, 
In the jasper wall be crowned, 
Saying, “Worthy is the Lamb,“ 
In the new Jerusalem.

O sinners, don’t be be doubting, 
While the sons of God are shouting; 
Come and join the happy army, 
And there’s nothing that will harm you. 
If you follow Christ the Savior, 
And break off your bad behavior, 
And repent and be converted, 
You may sing his praises too.

## 014. FREE GRACE

```txt
1. 
The voice of free grace 
Cries, escape to the mountain, 
For Adam’s lost race, 
Christ has opened a fountain, 
For sin and transgression 
And every pollution, 
The blood it flows freely 
In streams of salvation. 
The blood it flows freely  
In streams of salvation.

[Chorus] Hallelujah to the Lamb, 
Who hath purchased our pardon, 
We’ll praise him again, 
When we pass over Jordan, 
We’ll praise him again, 
When we pass over Jordan

2. 
This fountain so clear, 
In which all may find pardon, 
From Jesus’ side flows 
In plenteous redemption: 
Tho’ your sins they were raised 
As high as a mountain, 
The blood it flows freely 
From Jesus, the fountain. 
Hallelujah, etc.

3. 
O Jesus! ride on, 
Thy kingdom is glorious, 
Over sin, death and hell 
Thou wilt make us victorious, 
Thy name shall be praised 
In the great congregation, 
And saints shall delight 
Ascribing salvation. 
Hallelujah, etc.

4. 
When on Zion we stand, 
Having gain’d the blest shore, 
With our harps in our hands 
We will praise him evermore, 
We will range the blest fields 
On the banks of the river, 
And sing hallelujahs For ever and over. 
Hallelujah, etc.

## 012. THE CRUCIFIXION

```txt
1. 
As on the cross the Savior hung, 
And wept, and bled, and died. 
He poured salvation on a wretch 
That languished at his side.

2. 
His crimes with inward grief and shame, 
The penitent confessed; 
Then turned his dying eyes to Christ, 
And thus his prayer addressed;

3. 
‘Jesus thou Son and heir of heaven, 
‘Thou spotless Lamb of God, 
‘ I see thee bathed in sweat and tears, 
‘And weltering in thy blood.

4. 
‘Yet quickly from these scenes of wo, 
‘In triumph thou shalt rise, 
‘Burst through the gloomy shades of death, 
And shine above the skies.’

5. 
‘Amid the glories of that world, 
‘Dear Savior, think on me; 
‘And in the vict’ries of thy death, 
‘May I a sharer be.’

6. 
His prayer the dying Jesus heard 
And instantly replied, 
‘To-day thy parting soul shall be 
‘With me in paradise.’

I’ll take my staff and travel on, 
Till I a better world do view.

[Chorus] I’ll march to Canaan’s land, 
I’ll land on Canaan’s shore, 
Where pleasures never end,  
Where troubles come no more. 
Farewell, farewell, farewell, 
my loving friends, farewell.

2. 
Farewell, my friends, time rolls along, 
Nor waits for mortals’ care or bliss; 
I leave you here, and travel on, 
Till I arrive where Jesus is. 
I’ll march, etc.

2[sic] 
Farewell, my brethren in the Lord, 
To you I’m bound in cords of love; 
Yet we believe his gracious word, 
That soon we all shall meet above. 
I’ll march, & c.

4. 
Farewell, old soldiers of the cross, 
You’ve struggled long and hard for heaven; 
You’ve counted all things here but dross, 
Fight on, the crown will soon be given. 
I’ll march, & c. 
Fight on, & c.

5. 
Farewell, poor careless sinners too, 
It grieves my heart to leave you here, 
Eternal vengeance waits for you; 
O turn, and find salvation near. 
I’ll march, & c. 
O turn, & c.

## 019. WHAT SOUND IS THIS

```txt
From the Wesleyan Harp

1. 
What sound is this salutes my ear? 
‘Tis Gabriel’s trump methinks I hear, 
‘Tis Gabriel’s trump methinks I hear; 
The expected day has come. 
Behold the heav’ns, the earth, the sea, 
Proclaim the year of Jubilee, 
Proclaim the year of Jubilee, 
Return, ye exiles, home.

2. 
Behold the fair Jerusalem, 
IIluminated by the Lamb, 
Illuminated by the Lamb, 
In glory doth appear. 
Fair Zion rising from the tombs, 
To meet the Bridegroom, lo! he comes, 
To meet the Bridegroom, lo! he comes, 
And hails the festive year.

3. 
My soul is striving to be there; 
I long to rise and wing the air, 
And trace the sacred road. 
Adieu, adieu, all earthly things; 
O that I had an angel’s wings, 
I’d quickly see my God.

4. 
Fly, lingering moments, fly, O fly, 
I thirst, I pant, I long to try, 
Angelic joys to prove! 
Soon shall I quit this house of clay, 
Clap my glad wings and soar away, 
And shout redeeming love.

## 013. GODLY SORROW ARISING FROM THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST

```txt
1. 
Alas! and did my Savior bleed? 
And did my Jesus die? 
Would he devote that sacred head 
For such a worm as I?

2. 
Thy body slain, sweet Jesus, thine, 
And bath’d in its own blood, 
While all exposed to wrath of men, 
The glorious Sufferer stood!

3. 
Was it for crimes that I had done, 
He groaned upon the tree? 
Amazing pity! grace unknown! 
And love beyond degree!

4. 
Well might the sun in darkness hide, 
And shut his glories in, 
When Christ the glorious Savior died, 
For man, the creature’s sin.

5. 
Thus might I hide my blushing face, 
While his dear cross appears, 
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness, 
And melt mine eyes in tears.

6. 
But drops of grief can ne’er repay 
The debt of love I owe; 
Here, Lord, I give myself away; 
‘Tis all that I can do.

Lo, self-moving it drives on its pathway of cloud, 
And the heav’ns with the burden of Godhead are bow’d.

2. 
The glory, the glory around him are pour’d, 
Mighty hosts of the angels that wait on the Lord; 
And the glorified saints and the martyrs are there, 
And there all who the palm-wreaths of victory wear.

3. 
The trumpet! the trumpet! the dead have all heard; 
Lo, the depths of the stone-covered charnel are stirr’d’ 
From the sea, from the earth, from the south, from the north, 
All the vast generations of men are come forth.

4. 
The judgment! the judgment! the thrones are all set, 
Where the Lamb and the white vested elders are met, 
There all flesh is at once in the sight of the Lord, 
And the doom of eternity hangs on his word.

5. 
O mercy! O mercy! look down from above; 
Great Creator, on us, thy sad children, with love; 
When beneath to their darkness the wicked are driven, 
May our justified souls find a ransom in heaven.

Fight on ye conquering saints, fight on, 
And when the conquest you have won, 
Then palms of victory you shall bear, 
And in his kingdom have a share, 
And crowns of glory you shall wear,

4. 
Thy blood, dear Jesus, once was spilt, 
To save our souls from sin and guilt; 
And sinners now may come to God, 
And find salvation through his word, 
And sail by faith upon that flood 
To endless day.

5. 
There we shall in sweet chorus join, 
And saints and angels all combine, 
To sing of his redeeming love, 
When rolling years shall cease to move; 
And that shall be the theme above, 
In endless day.

        Millenial Harp 028. Star of Bethlehem. 1. When marshall’d on the nightly plain, The glittering hosts bestud the sky, One star alone, of all the train, Can fix the sinner’s wandering eye: Hark! Hark! to God the chorus breaks, From ev’ry host, from ev’ry gem; But one alone, the Savior speaks, It is the star of Bethlehem.

## 028. STAR OF BETHLEHEM

```txt
1. 
When marshall’d on the nightly plain, 
The glittering hosts bestud the sky, 
One star alone, of all the train, 
Can fix the sinner’s wandering eye: 
Hark! Hark! to God the chorus breaks, 
From ev’ry host, from ev’ry gem; 
But one alone, the Savior speaks, 
It is the star of Bethlehem.

2. 
Once on the raging seas I rode, 
The storm was loud, the night was dark, 
The ocean yawn’d, and rudely blow’d 
The wind that toss’d my foundering bark. 
Deep horror then my vitals froze, 
Death struck-I ceased the tide to stem: 
When suddenly a star arose, 
It was the Star of Bethlehem.

3. 
It was my guide, my light, my all, 
It bade my dark foreboding cease; 
And thro’ the storm and danger’s thrall, 
It led me to the port of peace. 
Now safely moor’d-my perils o’er, 
I’ll sing first in night’s diadem, 
Forever and forevermore, 
The Star-the Star of Bethlehem.

## 027. SAINT’S SWEET HOME

```txt
1. 
Mid scenes of confusion and creature complaints, 
How sweet to my soul is communion with saints; 
To find at the banquet of mercy there’s room, 
And feel in the presence of Jesus at home.

CHORUS. 
Home, home, sweet, sweet home, 
Prepare me, dear Savior, to glory, my home.

2. 
Sweet bonds that unite all the children of peace! 
And thrice precious Jesus whose love cannot cease, 
Though oft from thy presence in sadness I roam, 
I long to behold thee, in glory at home.

Home, home, sweet, sweet home, 
Prepare me, dear Savior, to glory, my home.

3. 
I sigh from this body of sin to be free, 
Which hinders my joy and communion with thee; 
Tho’ now my temptations like billows may foam, 
All, all will be peace, when I’m with thee at home.



4. 
While here in the valley of conflict I stay, 
O give me submission and strength as my day; 
In all my afflictions to thee would I come, 
Rejoicing in hope of my glorious home.



5. 
Whate’er thou deniest, O give me thy grace, 
The Spirit’s sure witness, and smiles of thy face; 
Indulge me with patience to wait at thy throne, 
And find even now a sweet foretaste of home.



6. 
I long, dearest Lord, in thy beauties to shine, 
No more as an exile, in sorrow to pine, 
And in thy dear image, arise from the tomb, 
With glorified millions to praise thee, at Home.

Home, home, sweet, sweet home, 
Prepare me, dear Savior, to glory, my home.

## 026. THE HARVEST HOME

```txt
1. 
Though in the outward church below, 
The wheat and tares together grow; 
Jesus ere long will weed the crop, 
And pluck the tares in anger up.

CHORUS. 
For soon the reaping time will come, 
And angels shout the harvest home.

2. 
Will it relieve their horrors there, 
To recollect their stations here; 
How much they heard, how much they knew, 
How much among the wheat they grew?



3. 
No! this will aggravate their case, 
They perish’d under means of grace. 
To them the word of life and faith 
Became an instrument of death.



4. 
We seem alike when thus we meet, 
Strangers might think we all were wheat, 
But to the Lord’s all-searching eyes, 
Each heart appears without disguise.



5. 
The tares are spared for various ends, 
Some for the sake of praying friends: 
Others the Lord, against their will, 
Employs his counsels to fulfil.



6. 
But though they grow so tall and strong, 
His plan will not require them long; 
In harvest, when he saves his own, 
The tares shall into hell be thrown.



7. 
Oh! awful thought, and is it so? 
Must all mankind the harvest know? 
Is every man a wheat or tare? 
Me, for that harvest, Lord, prepare.

[4]

```txt
1. 
I would not live alway: I ask not to stay, 
Where storm after storm rises o’er the dark way 
The few lurid mornings that dawn on us here, ... 
Are enough for life’s woes, full enough for its cheer.

2. 
I would not live alway: No-welcome the tomb, 
Sice[sic] Jesus has lain there, I dread not its gloom 
There, sweet be my rest, till he bid me arise, .... 
To hail him in triumph descending the skies.

3. 
Who, who would live alway, away from his God? 
Away from yon heaven, that blissful abode, 
Where rivers of pleasure flow o’er the bright plains, 
And the noon-tide of glory eternally reigns;

4. 
Where saints of all ages in harmony meet, 
Their Savior and brethren, transported to greet? 
Where anthems of rapture unceasingly roll. 
And the smile of the Lord is the feast of the soul.

I’m not, ashamed to own my Lord, 
Who lives by angels now adored; 
That Jesus who once died for me, 
Who bore my sins in agony.

2. 
I’m not ashamed to own his laws, 
Nor to defend his noble cause, 
The way he’s gone, is lined with blood, 
O may I tread the steps he trod.

3. 
I’m not ashamed his name to bear, 
With those who his disciples were: 
Christian, sweet name! its worth I view, 
O may I wear the nature too.

4. 
I’m not ashamed to bear my cross, 
For which I count all things but dross; 
Whate’er I’m bid to do or say, 
When Christ commands, I will obey.

5. 
I’m not ashamed to be despised, 
By those who ne’er religion prized: 
Nor will I prove to Christ untrue, 
For all that men can say or do.

6. 
This world’s vain honors will I shun, 
The narrow way to life I’ll run; 
That this at last my boast may be, 
My Savior’s not ashamed of me.

## 006. HUMAN FRAILTY

```txt
1. 
This world is all a fleeting show, 
For man’s probation given; 
The smiles of joy, the tears of wo, 
Deceitful shine, deceitful flow; 
There’s nothing true as heaven.

2. 
Poor wanderers of a stormy day, 
From wave to wave we’er driven; 
And fancy’s flash, and reason’s ray 
Serve but to light us on the way; 
There’s nothing bright as heaven.

3. 
And where’s the hand held out to cheer 
The heart with anguish riven? 
For sorrow’s sigh, and trouble’s tear, 
Have never found a refuge here; 
There’s nothing kind as heaven.

4. 
In vain do mortals sigh for bliss, 
Without their sins forgiven: 
True pleasure, everlasting peace, 
Are only found in God’s free grace; 
There’s nothing good as heaven.

5. 
From those who walk in wisdom’s way, 
Corroding fears are driven; 
They’re wash’d in Christ’s atoning blood, 
Enjoy communion with their God, 
And find their way to heaven.

While angelic legions, with harps tuned celestial, 
Harmoniously join in the concert of praise, 
The saints, as they flock from the regions terrestrial, 
In loud hallelujahs their voices will raise: 
Then songs to the Lamb shall re-echo thro’ heaven, 
My soul will respond, To Immanuel be given 
All glory, all honor, all might and dominion, 
Who brought us thro’ grace to the Eden of Love.

3. 
Then hail, blessed state! hail, ye songsters of glory! 
Ye harpers of bliss, soon I’ll meet you above! 
And join your full choir in rehearsing the story, 
“Salvation from sorrow, through Jesus’s love:” 
Though ‘prisoned in earth, yet by anticipation, 
Already my soul feels a sweet prelibation 
Of joys that await me, when freed from probation: 
My heart’s now in Heaven, the Eden of Love.

To mourning wander’rs given; 
There is a joy for souls distress’d, 
A balm for every wounded breast, 
‘Tis found alone in heaven.

2. 
There is a soft, a downy bed, 
As fair as breath of even; 
A couch for weary mortals spread, 
Where they may rest the aching head, 
And find repose in heaven.

3. 
There is a home for weary souls, 
By sin and sorrow driven; 
When tossed on life’s tempestuous shoals, 
Where storms arise and ocean rolls 
And all is drear-but heaven.

4. 
There faith lifts up the tearless eye, 
To brighter prospects given; 
It views the tempest passing by, 
Sees evening shadows quickly fly, 
And all serene-in heaven.

5. 
There fragrant flowers immortal bloom, 
And joys supreme are given; 
There rays divine disperse the gloom:— 
Beyond the dark, the narrow tomb 
Appears the dawn of heaven.

From every mortal treasure,

That leaves our breast to-day 
Or threatens us to-morrow, 
Hope turns our eyes away, 
On wings of faith ascending, 
We see the land of light, 
And feel our sorrows ending, 
In infinite delight.

3. 
‘Tis true, we are but strangers, 
We sojourn here below; 
And countless snares and dangers 
Surround the path we go; 
Though painful and distressing, 
Yet there’s a rest above; 
And onward still we’re pressing, 
To reach that land of love.

1. 
How long, O Lord our Savior, 
Wilt thou remain away? 
Our hearts are growing weary 
Of thy so long delay. 
O when shall come the moment 
When, brighter far than morn, 
The sunshine of thy glory 
Shall on thy people dawn?

2. 
How long, O gracious Master, 
Wilt thou thy household leave? 
So long hast thou now tarried, 
Few thy return believe, 
Immers’d in sloth and folly, 
Thy servants Lord, we see; 
And few of us stand ready 
With joy to welcome thee.

3. 
How long, O heav’nly Bridegroom, 
How long wilt thou delay? 
And yet how few are grieving 
That thou dost absent stay! 
Thy very Bride her portion 
And calling hath forgot, 
And seeks for ease and glory 
Where thou, her Lord, art not.

4. 
O wake thy slumbering virgins; 
Send forth the solemn cry, 
Let alt thy saints repeat it, 
“The Bridegroom draweth nigh!” 
May all our lamps be burning, 
Our loins well girded be, 
Each longing heart preparing 
With joy thy face to see.

Your Great Deliverer’s nigh

2. 
The morning light is beaming; 
The “day-star” shines on high, 
Christ’s Heralds are proclaiming 
His coming in the sky; 
And earth’s eventful story 
A few short months will tell, 
The righteous rise to glory; 
The wicked sink to hell.

3. 
If earth and all her treasure, 
Are doom’d to fire and flame; 
Her Royal pomp, and pleasure 
Are but an  
Her Kings-her Crowns-her glory 
Her Armies-Fleets-and pride, 
May bubble forth her story 
While floating down the tide.

4. 
The Ocean, Oh! the ocean, 
To which  grandeurs tend 
Now foams in dreadful motion, 
Her boast and pomp to end. 
See, see, the flames ascending, 
The seas, themselves explode; 
The clouds,—the skies, are rending 
With cries of—‘God’—‘Oh! God’!!

5. 
Oh! hear the sad petition, 
“Rocks crush us into dust;” 
Oh! pity our condition- 
Or  we surely must 
We thought that we were wiser 
Than  and all 
Yet Sinner—Sceptic—miser— 
Must suffer once for all.

6. 
Ye mortals take the warning, 
Ten thousand calls invite; 
Should you neglect the morning 
Then comes the  
Now mercy’s hand extended. 
The vilest wretch would save; 
But Oh! if  be ended 
You’re lost beyond the grave.

7. 
Great Author of compassion 
Redeemer-Saviour-friend- 
Oh! send to every nation 
The knowledge of its end; 
Fly! fly on wings of morning, 
Ye who the truth can tell, 
And sound the awful warning, 
To rescue souls from

## 001. HOW LONG, O LORD

```txt
1. 
“How long, O Lord, how long?”— 
It was in heav’n 
That prayerful voice was heard, 
From souls forgiven.

2. 
Was heaven not enough? 
Happy, secure, 
Robed in eternal bliss 
Would they have more.

3. 
Jesus! they would have more- 
Even in bliss, 
The souls expectant wait 
More happiness.

4. 
They wait, even in heaven, 
Impatiently, 
To see this troubled world 
At peace with thee.

5. 
They would behold their King, 
Once crucified, 
Mistrusted still, disowned, 
And still denied,—

6. 
Jesus! they would behold 
Thy work complete, 
And misery and sin 
Beneath thy feet.

7. 
And may not we, too, join 
In heaven’s song? 
Should we alone not ask, 
“How long, how long?”

Lo, what a glorious sight appears,

‘Tis there we’ll meet at Jesus’ feet, 
When we meet to part no more.

From the third heav’n, where God resides, 
That holy, happy place;

Adorned with shining grace.

Mortals behold the sacred sear 
Of your descending King!

“The God of glory down to men 
Removes his blest abode; 
Men are the objects of his love, 
And he their gracious God.

## 009. THE GREAT PHYSICIAN

```txt
1. 
How lost was my condition, 
Till Jesus made me whole; 
There is but one Physician 
Can cure a sin-sick soul; 
Next door to death he found me, 
And snatch’d me from the grave, 
To tell to all around me 
His wondrous power to save.

2. 
The worst of all diseases 
Is light, compared with sin; 
On every part it seizes, 
But rages most within; 
‘Tis palsy, plague, and fever, 
And madness all combined; 
And none but a believer, 
The least relief can find.

3. 
From men great skill professing, 
I sought a cure to gain; 
But this proved more distressing, 
And added to my pain. 
Some said that nothing ail’d me, 
Some gave me up for lost; 
Thus every refuge failed me, 
And all my hopes were cross’d.

4. 
At length this great physician, 
How matchless is his grace! 
Accepted my petition, 
And undertook my case; 
First gave me sight to view him, 
For sin mine eyes had seal’d, 
Then bade me look unto him; 
I look’d-and I was heal’d.

## 031. ESCAPE FOR THY LIFE

```txt
1. 
See Sodom wrapt in fire! 
And hark, what piercing shrieks! 
Those daring rebels now expire, 
For God in justice speaks.

2. 
O sinner, mark thy fate! 
Soon will the Judge appear; 
And then thy cries will come too late; 
Too late for God to hear.

3. 
Thy day of mercy gone, 
The Spirit grieved away, 
Thy cup, long filling, now o’erflown, 
Demands the vengeful day.

4. 
Thy God, insulted, seems 
To draw his glittering sword; 
And o’er thy guilty head it gleams, 
To vindicate his word.

5. 
One only hope I see; 
Oh, sinner, seize it now,— 
The blood that Jesus shed for thee! 
No other hope hast thou.

The Lord is our Shepherd, our guardian and guide; 
Whatever we want, he will kindly provide. 
To th’sheep of his pasture his mercies abound. 
His care and protection his flock will surround.

2. 
The Lord is our Shepherd; what then shall we fear, 
What danger can frighten us while he is near? 
Not when the time calls us to walk thro’ the vale 
Of the shadow of death, shall our hearts ever fail.

3. 
Tho’ afraid of ourselves, to pursue the dark way, 
Thy rod and thy staff be our comfort and stay; 
For we know by thy guidance, when once it is past, 
To a fountain of life it will bring us at last.

4. 
The Lord is become our salvation and song, 
His blessings have follow’d us all our life long; 
His name will we praise while we have any breath; 
Be cheerful in life, and be happy in death.

O, Savior of sinners, when faint and depressed, 
With manifold trials and sorrows oppressed, 
I’ll bow at thy feet, and with confidence cry, 
“Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I!”

2. 
When tempted by Satan the Spirit to grieve, 
And the service of Christ, my Redeemer to leave, 
I’ll claim my relation to Jesus on high- 
The Rock of salvation, that’s higher than I!

3. 
When judgments, O Lord, are abroad in the land, 
And merited vengeance descends from thy hand! 
O’erwhelmed with the sight, for protection I’ll fly, 
And hide in the Rock, that is higher than I!

4. 
When summoned by death before God to appear, 
By free-grace supported I’ll yield without fear! 
Most gladly I’ll venture with Jesus on high, 
To enter the Rock that is higher than I!

5. 
‘Tis there, with the chosen of Jesus, I long 
To dwell, and eternally join in the song, 
Of praising and blessing with angels on high, 
Christ Jesus, the Rock that it higher than I!

My shield and tower.

Through Jesus’ blood.

He by Himself hath sworn, 
I on his oath depend, 
I shall on eagles’ wings upborne 
To Heaven ascend: 
I shall behold his face, 
I shall his power adore, 
And sing the wonders of his grace 
Forevermore.

Lift your heads, ye friends of Jesus, 
Partners in his patience here; 
Christ to all believers precious, 
Lord of lords, shall soon appear: 
Mark the tokens, 
Mark the tokens, 
Mark the tokens 
of his heavenly kingdom near.

2. 
Hear all nature’s groans proclaiming 
Nature’s swift approaching doom! 
War, and pestilence, and famine, 
Signify the wrath to come; 
Cleaves the centre, 
Nations rush into the tomb.

3. 
Close behind the tribulation 
Of the last tremendous days, 
See the flaming Revelation! 
See the universal blaze! 
Earth and heaven 
Melt before the Judge’s face.

4. 
Sun and moon are both confounded, 
Darken’d into endless night, 
When with angel-hosts surrounded, 
In his Father’s glory bright, 
Beams the Savior, 
Shines the everlasting light.

5. 
See the stars from heaven falling! 
Hark! on earth the doleful cry! 
Men on rocks and mountains calling, 
While the frowning Judge draws nigh; 
Hide us, hide us, 
Rock and mountains, from his eye!

6. 
With what different exclamation 
Shall the saints his banner see! 
By the monuments of his passion, 
By the marks received for  
All discern him, 
All with shouts cry out—“‘Tis He!”

7. 
“Lo! ‘tis He! our heart’s desire, 
Come for his espoused below; 
Come to join us with the choir, 
Come to make our joys o’erflow: 
Palms of victory, 
Crowns of glory to bestow.”

8. 
Yes, the prize shall sure be given; 
We his open face shall see: 
Love, the earnest of our heaven, 
Love our full reward shall be; 
Love shall crown us 
Kings thro’ all eternity.

```txt
1. 
Why do we mourn departing friends, 
Or shake at death’s alarms? 
‘Tis but the voice that Jesus sends 
To call them to his arms.

2. 
Are we not lending upward too, 
As fast as time can move? 
Nor should we wish the hours more slow, 
To keep us from our love.

3. 
Why should we tremble to convey 
Their bodies to the tomb? 
There the dear flesh of Jesus lay, 
And left a long perfume.

4. 
The graves of all his saints be blest, 
And soften’d every bed; 
Where should the dying members rest, 
But with their dying Head.

5. 
Thence he arose, ascending high, 
And show’d our feet the way: 
Up to the Lord our flesh shall fly, 
At the great rising day.

6. 
Then tot the last trumpet sound, 
And bid our kindred rise; 
Awake, ye nations under ground; 
Ye saints, ascend the skies.

```txt
1. 
Wandering pilgrims, mourning Christians, 
Weak and tempted Lambs of Christ, 
Who endure great tribulation, 
And with sin are sore distress’d, 
Christ hath sent me to invite you, 
To a rich and costly feast; 
Let not shame or pride prevent you,  
Come the rich provision taste.

2. 
If you have a heart lamenting 
And bemoan your wretched case, 
Come to Jesus Christ, repenting, 
He will give you gospel grace: 
If you want a heart to fear him, 
Love and serve him here below; 
With your troubles now draw near him, 
He the blessing will bestow.

3. 
If, like poor Bartimeus blinded, 
You bewail the want of sight, 
Cry to Jesus, son of David, 
He will give you gospel light: 
If no one appear to help you, 
All their efforts prove but talk: 
Jesus ready waits to heal, you, 
He will bid you rise and walk.

4. 
If, like Peter, you are sinking 
In the sea of unbelief; 
Wait with patient, constant praying, 
Christ will grant you sweet relief. 
Are you weary, heavy laden? 
He will give you sweet repose; 
Bear his light and easy burden, 
He shall conquer all your foes.

5. 
He will give you grace and glory, 
All your wants shall be supplied: 
Canaan, Canaan, lies before you, 
Rise, and cross the swelling tide. 
Death shall not destroy your comfort, 
Christ shall guide you thro’ the gloom, 
Down he’ll send an heavenly convoy, 
To convey you to his home.
